# UnityPlatformer
Scripts from an old game development project from CAVC

2D procedurally generated platformer, code creates levels, decides the number of platforms to create based off the current level, after a point, enemies are spawned on platforms.

A few platform types, start platform, dropping platform, checkpoint platform and finish platform. Names are self-explanatory.

A (hopefully at the time of reading) playable version of the game will be in the "releases" section.
